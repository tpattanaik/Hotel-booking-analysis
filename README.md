# Hotel-booking-analysis
For this EDA Project, I have used Hotel booking dataset.
This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information
such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and
the number of available parking spaces, among other things.
**Problem statement**

We need to explore and analyze the data to discover important factors that govern the bookings of a
Hotel.

**Introduction**

Hotel industry is a very volatile industry and the bookings depend on variety of factors such as type of hotels, seasonality, days of week and many more. This makes analyzing the patterns available in the past data more important to help the hotels plan better. Using the historical data, hotels can perform various campaigns to boost the business. We will be using the data available to analyze the factors affecting the hotel bookings. These factors can be used for reporting the trends and predict the future bookings.

**Packages Required**

To do the EDA of the dataset, we required following packages firstly imported to the notebook. This will help us to do code and get a clear picture of the data.
The packages are:
Numpy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
